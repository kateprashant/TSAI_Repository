1.	Convolution - Convolution convolve the input(zip) and pass its result to the next layer.
2.	Filters/Kernels - A kernel is a smaller-sized matrix in comparison to the input dimensions of the image, that consists of real valued                        entries.
3.	Epochs – it is number of times (number of cycles to access database) we are accessing the database
4.	1x1 Convolution- The process of multiplying the input image with a 1 X 1 sized filter
5.	3x3 Convolution - The process of multiplying the input image with a 3 X 3 sized filter
6.	Feature Maps – it is the result after applying filter on image 
7.	Activation Function - A mathematical function that defines the minimum threshold at which a filter would consider a particular feature
8.	Receptive Field – The “receptive field” in a layer would be the cross section of the previous layer from which neurons provide inputs
